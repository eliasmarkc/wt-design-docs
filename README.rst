About
=====

What is Whole Tale?
-------------------

Whole Tale is an NSF-funded Data Infrastructure Building Block (DIBBS)
initiative to build a scalable, open source, web-based, multi-user **platform 
for reproducible research** enabling the creation, publication, and execution of 
*tales* -- executable research objects that capture **data**, **code**, and the 
**complete software environment** used to produce research findings.

A beta version of the system is available at
https://dashboard.wholetale.org.  

The Whole Tale platform has been designed based on **community input** primarily
through `working groups <https://wholetale.org/working_groups.html>`_ and
collaborations with researchers.

The Whole Tale project is involved in several initiatives to train researchers
for reproducibility as well as use of Whole Tale in the classroom.

A Platform for Reproducible Research
------------------------------------

The goal of Whole Tale is to enable researchers to define and create 
**computational environments** to (easily) manage the complete 
conduct of computational experiments and **expose** them for **analysis 
and reproducibility**. The platform addresses two trends;

* improved transparency so people can **run much more ambitious computational experiments**
* better computational experiment infrastructure to  allow researchers to be **more transparent**


Why Whole Tale?
---------------

The Whole Tale platform is being developed to simplify the adoption of practices
that improve the understandability and reproducibility of computational
research.

Technological Sources of Impact
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Virtually all published discoveries today have data and computational components.
There is a mismatch between traditional scientific dissemination practices and 
modern computational research practice leads to reproducibility concerns.

Computational Reproducibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Whole Tale platform supports computational reproducibility by enabling 
researchers to create and package code, data and information about the 
workflow and computational environment necessary to support review and 
reproduce results of computational analysis that are reported in published 
research.  Whole Tale implements this definition by supporting explicit 
citation of externally referenced data, capturing the artifacts and provenance 
information needed to facilitate understanding, transparency, and execution of
the computational processes and workflows used for review and reproducibility 
at the time of publication.


Who is Whole Tale for?
----------------------

Researchers 
^^^^^^^^^^^

Researchers are increasingly adopting practices to improve the transparency and
reproducibility of their own computational research.  Some are self-motivated to
improve their own rigor and transparency while others are responding to the
demands and requirements of  academic communities and journals.  Some are
advanced tool users with sophisticated methods of packaging and distributing
scientific software, often with automated testing and verification. Others are
more concerned with the research product than learning new tools and 
infrastructure for sharing and transparency.


Societies/Communities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Academic societies, associations and communities are responding to challenges in
the reproducibility of published research by adopting recommendations,
guidelines, and policies that impact publishers, editors, and researchers.
Communities are beginning to adopt practices encouraging or requiring 
sharing of code and data. Some are even implementing verification and evaluation
processes to confirm the reprodubility of published work. 

Editors
^^^^^^^

In response to the demand of academic communities to address problems of
reproducibility and reuse, journal editors are increasingly adopting guidelines
and enforcing policies for the sharing of data, code and information about the
software environment used in published research based on computational analysis.

Curators and Reviewers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The scholarly publication process has built-in mechanisms for anonymous peer
review. Some communities are adopting replication practices to ensure that
published research can be replicated at various levels. Anonymous reviewers and
curators of research artifacts play an important role in the quality of research
artifacts.

Repository Developers and Operators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Developers and operators of research data repositories are faced with the
challenge of addressing the needs of their communities through support for new
types of scholarly objects, methods of access, and processes for review and
verification.


What is a Tale?
---------------

A *tale* is an **executable research object** that combines data (references), 
code (computational methods), computational environment, and narrative 
(traditional science story). Tales are captured in a standards-based format
complete with metadata.
