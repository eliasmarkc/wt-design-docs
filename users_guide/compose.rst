Environments
------------
The **Create New Tale** window includes a drop-down list of available
environment that have programming frontends inside. For example, the **RStudio** Environment
is bundled with RStudio while the **Jupyter Notebook** Environment is bundled
with Python and Jupyter Notebook. You'll want to pick the appropriate
Environment that supports the language that you're working in.

Provided Environments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Whole Tale provides a number of pre-build environments for convenience. To
create your own environment, refer to the documentation page on the page for
`creating environments`_.

  1. **RStudio**: Contains RStudio with R 3.4.1
  2. **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains Jupyter Notebook with Python 
  3. **JupyterLab**: The next generation user interface for Jupyter
  4. **Jupyter with Spark**: Jupyter Notebook bundled with Apache Spark
  5. **OpenRefine**: A frontend for cleaning messy data

.. _data-section:

Choosing Between Read only and Read/Write
-----------------------------------------
If you're creating a Tale that has external data, the data is placed in a read only folder to prevent accidental manipulation. In the case 
that you need to modify the data, select the "Read/Write" option before creating the Tale.

Launching the Tale
------------------
After you have finalized your tale and click `Create New Tale and Launch`, you'll be brought
to the **Run** page where it will start up, seen in the image below. From here
you can access the tale, along with an assortment of other actions that are
documented on the `run page`_.

Importing Datasets as Tales
---------------------------
Some third parties have integrated their services with Whole Tale to provide seamless integration between datasets and Tales.

Dataverse
^^^^^^^^^
Select Dataverse nodes have added support for creating Tales from dataset landing pages.

To create a Tale with a data file from a data package hosted by Dataverse, locate the file listing in the data package. The ``Whole Tale`` 
link under the Explore tab will launch Whole Tale in a new window, where you can further tailor the environment.

When the Tale properties satisfy your needs, data registration and Tale launching will begin after clicking ``Create New Tale and Launch``. Once 
the Tale is ready to launch, you'll be automatically re-directed to it.


DataONE
^^^^^^^
DataONE allows users to launch Tales with entire datasets. To create a Tale from a DataONE dataset, visit your dataset on the 
DataONE `demo server`_ and look for the ``Analyze`` dropdown menu in the citation and downloads bar.
