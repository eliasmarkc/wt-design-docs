Compose: Creating New Tales
===========================

The **Compose** page allows you to create new tales that can be executed and 
shared with others. Creating a tale can be done in three steps:

  1. Name the Tale
  2. Select an Environment
  3. Select your data

.. _environment-section:

Environments
------------
On the right hand side of the screen there is a list of environments that
have programming frontends inside. For example, the **RStudio** Environment
is bundled with RStudio while the **Jupyter Notebook** Environment is bundled
with Python and Jupyter Notebook. You'll want to pick the appropriate
Environment that supports the language that you're working in.

Provided Environments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Whole Tale provides a number of pre-build environments for convenience. To
create your own environment, refer to the documentation page on the page for
`creating environments`_.

  1. **RStudio**: Contains RStudio with R 3.4.1
  2. **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains Jupyter Notebook with Python 
  3. **Jupyter with Spark**: Jupyter Notebook bundled with Apache Spark
  
To find more information about an environment, click the blue info icon next
to the Environment's name.

Selecting an Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To select an Environment that's right for you, mouse over and select
the Environment. You'll see the Environment appear under the Tale name, seen 
below.

     Once an Environment is selected, it should appear under the Tale name.

.. _data-section:

Data
----
Adding Data
^^^^^^^^^^^
The data browser in the lower right hand side is used to add data to your tale.
You can add data from the both the **Data** and **Home** folders by clicking on
either and selecting data inside. You can confirm that the data has been added
by scanning the **Input data** field below the Environment. As you select files,
they'll be added to the list. A complete tale with data can be seen below.

     A tale that is ready to be launched should include a name, Environment, 
     and data.

Once the Tale has been created, data can be freely added and removed in the Run tab.

.. _launching-section:

Launching the Tale
------------------
After you have finalized your tale and click `Launch New Tale`, you'll be brought
to the **Run** page where it will start up, seen in the image below. From here
you can access the tale, along with an assortment of other actions that are
documented on the `run page`_.

.. _importing-section:

Importing Datasets as Tales
---------------------------
Some third parties have integrated their services with Whole Tale to provide seamless integration between datasets and Tales.

Dataverse
^^^^^^^^^
Select Dataverse nodes have added support for creating Tales from dataset landing pages.

To create a Tale with a data file from a data package hosted by Dataverse, locate the file listing in the data package. The ``Whole Tale`` 
link under the Explore tab will launch Whole Tale in a new window, where you can further tailor the environment.

When the Tale properties satisfy your needs, data registration and Tale launching will begin after clicking ``Launch New Tale``. Once 
the Tale is ready to launch, you'll be automatically re-directed to it.

DataONE
^^^^^^^
DataONE allows users to launch Tales with entire datasets. To create a Tale from a DataONE dataset, visit your dataset on the 
DataONE `demo server`_ and look for the ``Analyze`` dropdown menu in the citation and downloads bar. 

.. figure:: images/compose/dataone_integration.png
     :align: center

     A DataONE package that supports Whole Tale integration.

After selecting one of the listed environments, you'll be transferred to the Whole Tale where you can further tailor your Tale. You may also 
select a different environment than the one that was chosen in DataONE. One customizations have been made, click the ``Launch New Tale`` button to
register the data and create the Tale.
