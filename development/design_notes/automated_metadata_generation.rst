This document is to keep track of what metadata is automatically generated by the Whole Tale system, and what the default values are. This is relevant to publishing tales on DataONE.


System Metadata Generation
--------------------------

Any file that doesn't already exist on DataONE needs to have a metadata document describing it's properties. This is accomplished by using 
*dataone_package.generate_system_metadata* which ends up calling the *d1_python* library. The object's MIME type md5, and size
are all put into the metadata document.

Additionally, system metadata is generated for both the EML document and the resource map


Rights Holder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The rights holder typically corresponds to a user's ORCID. Right now this is hard-coded and will be addressed with Globus-DataONE integration.

Access Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The metadata document hold information about who can access the data. By default, this is set to public and to read permissions.


Minimum EML Generation
----------------------

When uploading the package, a minimum EML record is required. This will/can be edited by the user at another step later in the process. The minimum record has documents the following

  1. The Title. This is set as the tale title
  2. The ``surName`` of the ``individualName`` in the ``creator`` field. This is currently set as the 
     ``lastName`` of the user.
  3. The ``surName`` of the ``individualName`` in the ``creator`` field. This is currently set as the 
     ``lastName`` of the user.
  4. A ``otherEntity`` block for each object. This includes a ``physical`` section outlining the size and name of the object.
  5. A section for the ``tale.yaml`` file.
