2019-06-17: Development Meeting
===============================
Craig, Tommy, Kacper, Adam, Mike H., Tim, Mike L.

Agenda
-----

* KNB & Arctic Data Center are ready to enable the`Launch in WT` button ([name=Tommy])
    * While re-testing it, I noticed that we have two progress bars (the one on the compose page + the notification panel).
    * These aren't completely in sync; the New Tale Modal (NTM) would presumably fix this?
    * I can give them the OK, or hold off until we deploy 0.8
    * Once the button is deployed on the two member nodes above, the DataONE leadership team will review it before deploying to `search.dataone.org`, which is the main portal

* Noted a few bugs in the comment [here](https://github.com/whole-tale/wt-design-docs/issues/85) while testing 0.7 ([name=Tommy])
    * Are any of these worth issues?
