2019-10-14: Development Meeting
===============================

Kacper, Tommy, Mike L, Craig, Elias, Mike H, Tim

Agenda
------
* Updates
* Discussion
    * XRAS proposal - [name=Kacper] [name=Craig]
    * Reproducible Run - [name=Craig]
        * Single tale, multiple runs
            * Each reproducible run is basically a tag that you can revert to
                * State of your workspace and metadata
            * Bertram: In a given workspace you can have the output of multiple run
                * Assumed this is the way it would be
                * No one else thought this way
            * Comparability
        * Tim: we need a fundamental model of what a Tale is
            * ER diagram
        * Distinguish between version and RR
            * Kacper: Any published RR is a version
            * Tim: 
                * There are versions of tales whether we record them or not
                * Checkpoint/tag: could be same as RR or not
                * RR: May mean that you have to create a checkpoint
                * Some RR may get published either through WT or to external repo
            * Kacper:
                * Create tale > tag > RR > publish
            * Kacper: Git/Github Analogy
                * Do two tags on local clone, push one to Zenodo (remote)
                * If you clone from Zenodo, you get one
                * But if you clone from WT source, you could get both of those tags
            * Mike H: Constrain
                * Before I publish, I do all sort of things that I don't want to be published. I only want to publish the version of the code.
            * Tim: What is the "tale"?
                * Need to clarify
                * Tale-in-WT
                    * Can have many tags/RRs
                * Copy-of-Tale-in-WT
                * Exported-Tale
                * Published-Tale-to-Zenodo
                    * Zenodo has only the selected tag/RR
                * Tale-in-WT-imported-from-Zenodo

        * Also trying to redesign/reimagine Tale Workspaces modal - current design could use some improvement
    * PR for "Currently running Tales" section
        * Spurred discussion about a [long-standing bug in instance deletion](https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/issues/495) - this has finally been fixed :tada: 
    * UI/UX discussions and clarifications (GitHub integration)

* Mike H
    * Expanded design [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hSMmHbTZGXPWSUd4dsENQlHTY483zpaOiF8eapN4VVg/edit)

* Tim
    * Wondering what others have found out about C2Metadata.
    * Much of discussion in Friday provenance call was attempt to clarify for Bertram what the model of a Tale is in Whole Tale. One 'reproducible run' per Tale at a particular point in time (or tag), or more than one?  Argued that a Tale represents (at a coherent checkpoint, not while things are in flux) the state of the Tale just following the 'reproducible run' that was just recorded. 
    * Intrigued by idea (Mike H) that there might be a practical way to include in a Tale information that can be used to compare against Reproducible Runs at different tags.
    * Has anyone looked into Argument Graphs, Micropublication, and Nanopublications with respect to connecting artifacts with published papers?
