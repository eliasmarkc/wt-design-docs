        * Reviewer runs editor's copy of the tale
    * Reviewer follows checklist
    * Editor can copy feedback to original tale

    * Q. We somehow need versioning?

        * Browse refactor
        * Pending PRs
            * Run view refactor
            * Copy on Launch
        * Possible:

            * Cleanup: Fix linter errors, Killing dead code
    * Elias:
        * Agave data provider in progress
    * Things that can be worked on 
        * Refactor notifications in both backend and UI for register data, import tale, stop instance, publishing?
            * Register data: refactor to use local jobs, UI changes to get away from black toast (delete dead code?)
            * Import tale: refactor to use chained jobs; UI changes because custom progress/panel is unnecessary
            * See also:
                * https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/issues/152
        * API keys for publishing (need design/mockups)
        * Manage/catalog refactor
            * Note http://www.crc.nd.edu/~kfurse/wholetale-css-mock-up-sui_f2018/browse-catalog-meta.html
        * Changing the environment (remix)
            * UI selection is easy, but needs to trigger something on the backend
            * https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/issues/268
        * More real tales (Tommy?)
        * Compute environments (needs design/mockups)
        * Killing all the dead code (ML)
        * Compose shouldn't build
            * https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/issues/288
            * Maybe unnecessary
        * Issue triage and closing
            * [Users shouldn't be able to delete a Tale that has running Instances/Sessions](https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/issues/166) could be done
        * Globus publish will be broken
