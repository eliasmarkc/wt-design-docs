Tim:

* There is the start of a [draft of a plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12t0G7-Y5EjX2yZelbj1TG2UjN7s2m0dH9HmS9pkN0JI/edit?usp=sharing) for the (mostly) provenance and (some) reproducibility features.
* Much of the discussion on Friday was about the implementation of the provenance store.
* It became clearer that manual entry of provenance information is critical so that no automated provenance capture too need be comprehensive.
* What are feelings about RDF documents vs triple stores vs relational databases vs JSON-LD, etc?  (Interestingly, no NoSQL options mentioned Friday. Are these options for storing and querying JSON-LD?  Maybe too big for Tales?)
