Agenda
------
* Updates
* Discussions
    * v0.8 RC1
        * Before cutting RC, want to fix:
            * https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/issues/523
            * https://github.com/whole-tale/girderfs/pull/12
        * And review
            * https://github.com/whole-tale/wt-design-docs/pull/87
    * Remote execution
        * Design document 
        * Figure out tasking
        * Agave communication channels?
        * SAGA/Apache Airavata
            * https://saga-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
            * https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRAVATA/Apache+Airavata+Overview
        * Also consider data locality? Ability to expose data known to be local without moving it
            * Globus: replica location service
            * DesignSafe and Cyverse data are on Agave-enable resources?
            * MH: 
                * We seem to be branching out into grid computing space, which is a quagmire
                * We should provide services to allow users to submit their own jobs on batch resources, empowering them to figure out where to and how to run things.
            * Motivating use cases: need to be realistic and detailed

                * https://wholetale.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development/design_notes/index.html

* Mike H
    * Looked into Agave stuff
    * Proof-of-concept: Tale running on compute node via Singularity/Agave and routed back
        * Forward port from compute node to some other point (e.g., SSH tunnel) to Whole Tale
        * Automated tunneling in Agave?
        
* Tommy
    * 0.8 documentation updates
    * Testing
        * https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/issues/337
        * KK: Was looking for proper term for file size and MD5 in BagIt
    * Feature request from Matt:
        * Reconstruct the filesystem paths when downloading an exported Tale from DataONE
        * Involves picking a vocab word from some vocabulary to describe the path and putting it in the resource map
        * Also involves modifying [Metacat](https://github.com/NCEAS/metacat) to parse the resource map when someone clicks `Download All` from MetacataUI.
        * I'm in the process of recommending `schema:contentUrl` (modifying their docs and then PR)
        * https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/pull/3412/files#diff-4e738a204ca5caaa8bca95e54aee845e
    * Q. CW
