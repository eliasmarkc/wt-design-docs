Updates
-------

* Tommy
    * Continued to look at the different information that YW and C2Meta have
        * Organizing things on the DataONE side (which of the info belongs in EML, which of it belongs in Resource map)
    * I've been compiling my results in an M$ Word doc, need to put it online in a google doc for everyone else
    * To Do: 
        * See where C2Meta is w.r.t generating EML. I know that it supports it, but to what extent. Note that we may not use its ability to generate EML since our current model has it being generated from the CPM
        * PR for some 0.9 doc updates (held off on screenshots until we have an RC)

* Craig
    * Crafting Dataverse announcement / documentation
    * Priorities:
        * v0.9 release testing, documentation, announcement planning

* Kacper
    * Done with v0.9 features (I think...)
    * Repo2docker refactoring (adding more composability)
    * Sharing + Git integration

* Mike L
    * Angular: started migrating user-settings / publish-modal, still in progress

* Tim
    * Updated Dockerfile for YW demonstration purposes, experimenting with distributing YW this way with commands for running YW, XSB, Graphviz etc transparently using the image (via small Go programs).
    * We can include YW, XSB, and Graphviz in WT images based on this (copy-paste from Dockerfile).
    * Diving into automating examples driving ReproZip, etc.
