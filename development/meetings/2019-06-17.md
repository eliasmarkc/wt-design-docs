* What's v0.8
    * Copy on Launch (old mockups)
    * Create modal (old mockups)
    * Import Tale: https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/pull/259
    * Run view refactor (old mockups)
    * Browse refactor (old mockups)
    * Notifications:
        * Fix the payload fields (title, etc)
    * Remix/environment selection ?
    * TBD:
        * "Import as Tale"
        * Browse refactor (new mockups)
        * Data catalog refactor (new mockups)
        * Data directory https://github.com/whole-tale/gwvolman/pull/39
* TBD
    * Notifications
        * Don't clear lastRead or store on user object
        * Past event handling
        * Next action handling (restart on build success)
        * New Girder API for update notification? 
        * Possibly using new notification REST API in place of event handler
    * Tale validation
    * Kubernetes
    * Brown Dog integration
    * Agave ingest
    * Native support for WT in Jupyter/RStudio (no longer a thing)
    * Tracking and storing provenance
    * Remixing (a handful of things)
    * OAI-ORE filesystem
