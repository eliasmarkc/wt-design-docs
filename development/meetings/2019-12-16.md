2019-12-16: Development Meeting
===============================

Kacper, Tim, Tommy, Mike L, Craig, Mike H, Elias

Agenda
------
* Updates
* Next dev meeting: 01/06/2020
* Versioning discussion
    * Kristina's work:
        * Right panel with "Tale History"
            * includes "run configuration" (allows to specify entrypoint etc.)
                * It feels a bit weird with both "save" and "apply"
                * Defaults should be changed to `run.sh` and `test.sh`
        * Left Panel under Run > Files (Archived Panel)
            * Saved versions
            * Recorded run
        * Mike:
            * The current mockup gives 0 status on your current run
            * Kacper: Move recorded runs to a new tab with Files, Metadata, Share, etc
            * We might be constrained by the previous designs(it's hard to navigate around-particularly things like running).

    * Meetings:
        * EarthCube - possible use of WT as a prototype (Analyze in WT using [GeoCODES](https://www.earthcube.org/geocodes) or DDS)
        * UI/UX meeting

* Tommy
    * Started 0.9 documentation
        * Updating publishing UI docs
        * Added docs for third party API integration
    * Code reviews
    * Looked at the connections between YW, Reprozip, and ProvONE
        * The conversion is possible; one next step is picking what information we want from each tool since there's a little overlap
    * 

* Tim
    * Got feedback from ReproZip team member (Remi Rampin) about the analysis of the ReproZip provenance model and schema. 
    * Confirmed we have to query both a YAML file and a SQLite database to answer questions of interest to Whole Tale.
    * https://github.com/whole-tale/wt-prov-model/pull/4#issuecomment-563370336
