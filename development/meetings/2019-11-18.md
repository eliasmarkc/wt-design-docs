2019-11-18: Development Planning
================================
Craig, Mike L., Kacper

* v0.9
    * User settings
        * DataONE + Zenodo
    * Register data from Zenodo (merged)
    * Publish to Zenodo (review)
    * Publish refactor (UI)
    * Run/import from Zenodo
        * Detect whether tale already exists (don't import blindly)
* Three different things
    * Registering a DOI, even if it is a tale, will always come in as data
    * For DOI that is not a real tale
        * asTale = true puts data in workspace
        * asTale = false puts in /data
    * For DOI that is actually a real tale
        * There is no asTale 
        * It's just an import
        * If I really want to use your tale as immutable data, I don't want a zipfile (probably)
* User flow
    * You found a tale in Zenodo and I have the DOI
    * 1) I want to run the tale as a tale
        * You don't need the modal, you just do it
    * 2) I want to analyze the tale as data using Jupyter
        * Registering the DOI today (for Zenodo) would give you a zipfile
* Discussion
    * Detecting a "binder" in Zenodo (it's a zip) versus a tale (it's a bag)
    * Differences in importing tales that are bags (Zenodo) v bags that are not tales (DataONE) v tales that are not bags at all?
        * DataONE has fairly specific dataone metadata that can be used to tell it's dataone
* How would we import from DataONE?
    * Integration converts to BagIt or Zip
    * Import could allow provider to specify the job
* Can I publish a non-public tale?
    * All published tales must be public?
