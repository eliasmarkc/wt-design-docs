            * Some open questions here about workflow:
                * Select Data is synchronous, but register is async - is this ok?
                * For example: a user can't register a dataset and associate it with a tale all at once
        * WIP Tale workspaces modal(s)
            * Do we like "Move to Workspace" / "Copy to Workspace" as options here?
            * Unclear if the current functionality fulfills the desired use case
