Updates
-------
* Tommy
    * ProvONE work [here](https://hackmd.io/H4wz_Q0tQui2v4-aXYANww)
        * Sent it to Matt, he wants to discuss with more NCEAS folks (but likes it so far)
        * Could possibly talk about it this Friday?
    * Upcoming Friday prov call
        * Victoria wants me to make a new event and re-send it around
    * Looked back at [UCSB/WT deliverables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wmESG6kRztkqVOPA-tyJ77vVw4d5x7oRXlD1D6Lp__c/edit#heading=h.331qi9xtfdnt) - here are some statuses
        * `Go to production with “Analyze in Whole Tale” in DataONE`
            * Relies on 0.9
        * `Support “update” for adding new versions of a tale to DataONE repos`
            * Bug in dataone python library where this only works every other time
            * I don't think anyone has allocation on that package, so I'll most likely have to track it down
        * `Add provenance (derivedFrom) predicates to tale published on DataONE as part of recorded run`
            * See the ProvONE work above
        * `Support publishing tales in DataONE that preserve folder hierarchies`
            * My Metacat deployment with this work is broken; I'm not sure where or why but I need to fix it to demo the work

* Kacper
    * Worked through the feedback after AHM, sumitted a few PRs (most of them have been merged)
    * Tagged rc3, about to release it to .stage
    * https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/pull/410

* Craig
    * Focusing on PresQT and C2Metadata deliverables

* Mike H
    * Versioning is ready for testing:
        * girderfs@versioning, girder_wholetale@versioning (potentially others)
        * new plugin
    * Test:
        * create an instance, mount the fs manually (documented in girderfs)
        * /create_checkpoint on instance
        * /run on version

* Mike L
    * Migrated angular rewrite to https://github.com/whole-tale/ngx-dashboard, needs testing
