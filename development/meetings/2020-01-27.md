2020-01-27: Development Meeting
===============================

Kacper, Craig, Tommy, Mike H, Tim, Mike L, Elias

Agenda
------
* Updates
* Reprozip/SciUnit -- [name=Tim]
    * Sciunit will log _some_ of the system calls, but you'd need to write a parser and _possibly_ reconstruct a data-process-graph
        * Not readily queryable
    * ReproZip gives a queryable (sql-lite) data-process-graph that doesn't need additional patching.
    * Tim will present during 2/7 prov/repro call
* Virtual Folders - quick demo -- [name=Kacper]
* Old issues -- [name=Tommy]
    * https://github.com/whole-tale/wt-design-docs/issues/22 - Closed
    * https://github.com/whole-tale/wt-design-docs/issues/20 - Closed
    * https://github.com/whole-tale/wt-design-docs/issues/92 - Closed
* Virtual AHM -- [name=Craig]

Updates
-------
* Tommy
    * RO Crate community call
        * Gave a quick intro to WT and where RO-Crate _may_ fit in
            * My opinion is something like v2.0 would be more appropriate when the [compute environment use case](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/39) is incorporated
        * There were a few other project introductions with similar use cases to ours (exporting things and describing them with a controlled vocab)
    * Emailed the DataONE community outreach coordinator about some sort of announcement for when they enable the button.
        * Might hold a webinar for DataONE node operators, users, etc
        * 0.9 fixes a bug fix that prevented test servers
    * Worked on the test case document with Craig
    * Testing
    * Added log out to the [right hand side menu](https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/pull/586)

* Kacper
    * Implemented [Homes/Workspace as virtual folders](https://hackmd.hub.yt/X5p2YZ9NT9WLJiq9SphIMA?edit) (code: https://github.com/whole-tale/virtual_resources)
    * [Sanitize imported file/folder names](https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/pull/382)

* Craig
    * v0.9 testing, test plan updates
        * Nothing major
    * SOMOSPIE tale (Jupyter + Spark + R) test case (due to demo tomorrow)

* Tim
    * ReproZip looks like a good place to start with our provenance framework.
        * [tmcphillips/wt-prov-model/notes](https://github.com/tmcphillips/wt-prov-model/blob/master/notes/)
    * Easy to extract provenance information and export to Prolog facts.
    * Have started set of examples:  [wt-prov-model/examples](https://github.com/tmcphillips/wt-prov-model/tree/master/examples).
        * Common Makefile runs an example via run.sh and reprozip, exports reprozip provenance as Prolog facts.
        * Will be adding provenance queries, visualizations, and more examples this week.
    
* Mike L
    * Saw some movement on the v0.9 test plan and checked for v0.9 test artifacts, but didn't see any yet.. once tagged, I can test
    * Minor PRs for Ember dashboard
        * [Add 'Settings' link to mobile nav menu](https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/pull/586)
        * [Treat `resource_server` link as absolute URL](https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/pull/582)
    * Still backporting some things to Angular
        * Updated styling for `publish-modal`
        * Attempted to fix modal scrolling
            * Material Dialog is not super flexible - may need a better/custom modal

* Mike H
    * Working on versioning using `virtual_folders`

* Elias
