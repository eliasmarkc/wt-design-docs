===============================

Kacper, Tommy, Tim, Mike H, Craig, Mike L

Agenda
------
* Updates
* Next steps for Versioning and Recorded Run
    * Mike's [WT Versioning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b2xZtIYvgVXz7EVeV-C18So_a7QLGg59dPQMxvBcA5o/edit?usp=sharing)
    * [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nf1aCd7M2ONVGLDR3AcMMIYb4cOsfF1WZeRE9JYfpSY/edit)
    * Tim: we need to talk about user experience with RR
        * If my run takes 2 hours to run, what do I see?
        * Are the file systems mounted? Do I see in real time? Can I "tail -f"?
    * Mike:
        * Runs would be mounted in the tale "root directory". We could allow them to reflect live status.
        * The POC interface shows progress.
        * Creating a Run creates an entry in the Run directory and panel.
    * Tim: Making it clear to the user where their files are.
    * Craig: The results directory exists outside of the Workspace
        * The results directory get moved/copied to the run when there's a new head.
        * Click Run -> You get a snapshot -> Executes entry point -> Get a copy in runs -> Continue working on the head
        * Local = Docker exec
        * Container = launching a separate container
    * Mike L:
        * When we copy a tale are we copying the recorded runs and versions for the tale?
        * KK: Copy on launch will also copy the versions/runs.
        * Mike: We should have a clear way to copy -- not traversing Girder job/outputs.
    * Craig:
        * What about sharing? 
        * KK: Need to make sure ACLs are respected. But "it's not complicated"
    * Next steps:
        * Mike H: proceeding with backend work
* AHM 3/3 - 3/6  -- JOMO (Joy Of Missing Out!)
