2018-06-25: Development meeting
===============================
Kacper, Tommy, Craig, Mihael, Sebastian, Damian

Agenda
------
* Updates
* MVP
  * Sprint ends tomorrow
  * Last thing is instantiating tales, but lots of minor things. Will add these to the next sprint.
  * Look at the [Invision doc](https://projects.invisionapp.com/freehand/document/nPpPcHSRg) as the source of truth -- to test and confirm that it's implemented as expected.
  * Discussion of arranging time to demonstrate MVP for feedback from PI team.
* v0.4 -- first build targeted for 7/8.


Updates
-------
 * Kacper
   * Environmental variables can be passed to a running Tale, using containerConfig.environment ([wholetale/girder_wholetale#102](https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/pull/102), [whole-tale/gwvolman@b4c068a0](https://github.com/whole-tale/gwvolman/commit/b4c068a0d81e19ff43602cf7ed5696e39d98297e)). This will enable iframeable Tales that are independent of deployment URL.
   * Tales accept multiple sources as input data ([whole-tale/girder_wholetale#98](https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/pull/98))
   * WT Homes/Workspaces support moving data to other assetstores ([whole-tale/wt_home_dirs#9](https://github.com/whole-tale/wt_home_dirs/pull/9))
   * Working on tests for [whole-tale/girder_wholetale#100](https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/pull/100) takes much longer than I'd like.
* Bryce
    * No directly WT work this last week
    * Working on abstract for ResearchObjects 2018 conference. Mostly about DataONE and packaging but crosses over with WholeTale. I'll link the abstract here once drafted today. [link to conf](http://www.researchobject.org/ro2018/).
* Craig
  * Starting to work on user documentation
  * Starting to develop Postman tests -- initially for stress testing, but may also serve as preliminary integration tests
      * Q: Does it require healthcheck endpoints? A: It's not necessary, postman serves as a healthcheck itself.
  * Implemented Checkmk test for tale creation
  * Q. Home directories? A: Users will be able to select files/folders from home directory during compose. A "snapshot" will be created of those files for the lifetime of the tale (becomes immutable in tale, but could possibly be updated via API).
  * Comment: Ideally we can use RO paper as input into publisher working group.
* Damian
  * Working on the transition between tale creation and the run page. (Action Point: KK will deploy PR100 on dev deployment manually)
* Mihael
  * Working on Globus integration; potentially see GitHub activity in a few days 
* Sebastian
  * Working on transitions between various panels, need to use browser storage due to crossing views 
* Tommy
  * Created the tale.yml file and merged two metadata files into it. The PR is in GitHub. 
  * The 'file paths' (the directory structure) is complete; we should be able to "reconstruct" the FS in a way that the tale can run.
  * 90% of repository saving complete-testing plan for the worker?
  * Working on full use cases (Run page to DataONE and then back to WT)
  * Updating publishing & Serialization UI
  * Planning to do some UI testing
  * [Adding licence to tale during publication](https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/issues/149)
