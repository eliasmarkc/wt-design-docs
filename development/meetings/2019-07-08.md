2019-07-08: Development planning
================================
Kacper, Craig

* Priorities:
    * Finalize v0.8
        * Open PRs
            * [Browse refactor](https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/pull/478)
            * [Create tale modal](https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/pull/465)
        * Open issues (need to review)
            * [Ability to change environment](https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/issues/268)? 
                * Kacper: I can do it, since Tommy is on vacation.
            * [Create should take me immediately to Run > Interact](https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/issues/508)
                * ML: Should this also happen in Analyze in WT case?
            * [Run from browse should take me to the Run > Interact page](https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/issues/507)
                * ML: This would obviate lots of work; what happens if they hit back, do they expect to still see that working.
                    * This could be non-trivial
            * [Disable interact tab when not running](https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/issues/506)
                * ML: Seems reasonable, although this is where error handling happens during launch
            * ["View" link should take user to metadata tab if not running](https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/issues/505)
                * ML: Need to add a query string parameter for current tab.
            * [Metadata page should show Tale provenance](https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/issues/501)
            * [Include tale title in relevant notification](https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/issues/320)
    * Publishing to Dataverse and Zenodo (also ingest) including new 'User Settings' page
        * User setting page (Kirstina is working on mockups)
        * Ingest from Zenodo
    * Importing published tales
        * Need to translate from provider-specific stuff into serialized tale
        * Need DataONE implementation. Need to translate what provider has into our bagit format.
    * Improved github support
    * Sharing
    * Direct linking to tales (DOI resolution)
        * [Linking directly to tales](https://github.com/whole-tale/whole-tale/issues/68)
    * Kubernetes migration
* Still TBD
    * Angular migration
    * Re-executability
    * Transparency/provenance
    * Agave native data provider
    * Remote tale execution via Agave
    * Verification workflows
        * Publishing drafts
        * Anonymous review
        * etc.
