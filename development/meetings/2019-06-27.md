2019-06-27: Development planning
================================
Kacper, Craig


* Done but need Kristina's feedback
  * Copy on launch
  * Run view refactor
* Existing PRs (v0.8)
  * Browse refactor
  * Create tale modal
* In the pipeline
  * Notifications (past events, fix payloads)
      * Nobody asked for it yet, but it's in the mockups
  * Porting register and stop jobs to trigger notifications (not publishing)
  * Run page changes (read-only metadata page, disable interact -- ideally we think about this after Kristina's feedback on copy on launch, run view, etc).
  * Ember > Angular 
    * Browse refactor (new mockups)
    * Data catalog refactor (new mockups)
    * Publishing refactor
* TBD
  * Import tale from DataONE (or Dataverse or whatever)
      * Publish a tale that's already in WT
      * Someone tries to "import from DataONE"
          * The tale exists already
              * Detect if it exists (i.e., already has DOI in published IDs) -- return URL to tale not compose
          * The tale doesn't exist
              * Immediately parse manifest and take to the view page 
              * Make it a job with notifications, you watch the import progress then automatically redirect to interact?
          * The tale has changed
  * Import binder -- toggle is not necessarily a good idea
  * User settings tab (API keys, Oauth)
    * Needed for Tales at Scale, publishing
    * Ala https://osf.io/settings/addons/
  * Github integration
  * Sharing (ACLS)
      * Linking directly to unpublished tales
  * Anonymous review
  * Tale validation
  * Provenance UI
* Upcoming presentations
    * SciPy: lightning talk: Github backed tale that's binder compatible -- edit in WT, run in Binder.
* Recap
    * UI priorities
        * v0.8 (Browse refactor, create modal) + minor bug fixes
        * Ember > Angular refactor (can't start until after Mike returns)
            * Style/linter rules
    * Kristina mockups
        * User settings
        * Sharing (ACLS) 
            * Share read-only (therefore you get a copy)
            * Share read/write -- you and I are editing the same files.
        * Import tale -- needs to understand different flows
        * Github integration
        * Publishing refactor (more than one publisher, licenses, authentication, publish modal)
        * Anonymous review
