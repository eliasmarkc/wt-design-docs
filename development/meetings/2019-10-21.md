Updates
-------

* Tommy:
    * Currently in UCSB training thing (being safe online and other administrative things)-won't be on this call.
    * Started working on mapping a tale to RO-Crate
    * Should be turning on the Analyze in WT button (on DataONE) this week-chatted with the team about this last Thursday.
        * I have 4 people at NCEAS lined up to test it on a CN and MN before it goes live

* Kacper:
    * released v0.8 :tada:
    * Working on backend part of external accounts integrations
        * Tommy: Also chatted with D1 about the JWT. The CN mints the JWT and keeps some sort of record of it. When someone attempts to use a JWT, the CN checks if it minted that JWT. (So with accounts I think we need something more than ORCID for DataONE (If we were thinking ORCID only))
