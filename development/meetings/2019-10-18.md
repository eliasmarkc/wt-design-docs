2019-10-18: Development Planning
================================

Kacper, Craig

* User settings page
    * https://wholetale.org/wholetale-css-mockup/src/settings.html
    * Need to define tasks
        * girder_wholetale
            * First pass at the API
            * Working prototype before UI starts
        * dashboard
            * Add user settings page and menu item
            * Update [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10O3r0tZ7Q86uZLpmnhUaaMRIsM1c-gGYYzSc7bf9wO8/edit#)
            * Integrate with UI
* Sharing design
    * Ability to add collaborator with View/Edit APIs exists
    * Ability to invite someone is mostly there
        * Need to setup SMTP server
        * Invite user? Upstream contribution to Girder?
            * Migrate to 3.x
            * Non trivial
    * Add user Can View
        * User has read access to Tale
        * Equivalent to accessing public tale -- copy on launch
        * Appears in "All Tales" or "Shared with Me"?
    * Add user Can Edit
        * User has write access
        * Appears in "My Tales"
        * Users would share:
            * metadata
            * workspace content
            * external data
            * version
            * reproducible run
        * Users would not share:
            * Instance
            * Image? If I make changes to workspace and rebuild
                * That image is available to collaborator
            * Notifications are mine for building? Or shared?
                * Only logs for jobs?
                * We are building the same "image" for the tale
        * Open:
            * Can they publish?
            * What if I change the base image from R to Jupyter?
                * Changes tale object
            * How does it affect reproducible run and version?
                * Would want to know who ran the run/created version
