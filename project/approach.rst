Our Approach
============

Open Source Platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Whole Tale project is developing an open source platform and welcomes
both re-use and contribution from the research infrastructure community. 
As a building block, the platform is intended to be deployable in a variety 
of environments, including the primary service at
https://dashboard.wholetale.org.

Open Source Curriculum
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Whole Tale project is dedicated to the improvement of education and training
for reproducible research practices through the creation of open lessons both for
classroom instruction and through contributions to programs such as the Carpentries. 

Open Infrastructure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Whole Tale project aspires to contribute to and increase the impact of
existing open infrastructure projects. The success of Whole Tale depends on our
ability to connect users to the tools and information they need to create
reproducible research packages. The Whole Tale platform leverages components
from projects including `Girder <https://github.com/girder/girder>`_, 
`The Rocker Project <https://www.rocker-project.org/>`_, and `Project Jupyter
<https://jupyter.org/>`_.


Lowering Barriers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Whole Tale project draws on the experience and expertise of researchers and
communities that are working in the forefront of reproducible research
practices and applies these lessons to the development of a platform that is
intended to simplify and broaden the adoption of such practices.


Community Engagement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Through our `working groups <https://wholetale.org/working_groups.html>`_ and
workshops, we engage with a broad community of researchers, educators, and
infrastructure developers to inform Whole Tale project direction and platform
design.


Usability
^^^^^^^^^

As we develop a web-based platform, we recognize the importance of usability and
user experience and will continue to conduct regular usability tests to
improve the system.
